# Bank Loan: Detailed Python/SQL + Power BI + Analysis

## About this repo
This repository delivers a comprehensive analysis of **bank loan data**, leveraging **SQL (Python)**, and **Power BI** to transform raw Excel data into actionable business insights. The objective is to evaluate lending performance, loan quality, and portfolio trends through **three dashboards** and a structured analytical report.
The project follows a clear end-to-end workflow: **Problem Understanding → Data Processing → Dashboard Visualization → Insight & Recommendation**

## Repository contents
**1.** `problemstatement.pdf`: Describes the business requirement and analytical objectives, clearly specifies:
  * The need for **3 dashboards**, key metrics and dimensions required in each dashboard.
  * Expected analytical outcomes.

**2.** `financial_loan_data_excel.xlxs`: Contains the original bank loan dataset. Serves as the primary input for SQL queries, Python processing, and Power BI visualization.

**3.** `bankloan.sql`: Acts as the **main and most detailed data processing layer**, includes detailed SQL queries to:
  * Clean and transform raw data.
  * Aggregate metrics based on dashboard requirements.
  * Export structured datasets for analysis.

**4.** `bankloan.ipynb`: Provides an alternative data processing approach using Python (similar outputs but less detailed than the SQL script).

**5.** `bankloan.pbix`: Contains all interactive dashboards built according to the problem statement, includes:
  * Dashboard 1: Summary.
  * Dashboard 2: Overview.
  * Dashboard 3: Details.

**6.** `bankloan_powerbi.pdf`: Static version of the Power BI dashboards, allows easy viewing without Power BI Desktop.

**7.** `analysisreport.pdf`: The final report is structured into **four main sections**:
* **Chapter 1: Domain Knowledge**: Introduction to bank loans, loan approval process, and the importance of analyzing bank loan data.
* **Chapter 2: Terminologies in Data**: Explanation of key variables used in the raw dataset. Clarifing what each variable represents and why the bank needs this information for decision-making.
* **Chapter 3: Data Analysis**: Detailed analysis of all dashboards built in Power BI. Highlighting key trends, risk patterns and performance insights (all findings are supported by data and visuals).
* **Chapter 4: Conclusion and Recommendations**
